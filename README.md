# Call-Center-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Microsoft Powerbi)
 ## Project Objective  
The goal of this project was to review and analyze a simulated three-month dataset of call center operational metrics. The analysis focused on key performance indicators such as total calls received, call acceptance rates, and total handled time to identify trends, assess team performance, and recommend strategies for operational improvement.
## Insights  
- Over the three months, the call center handled 17,573 calls, with 12,244 calls resulting in acceptance, indicating an overall acceptance rate of approximately 69.7%.  
- Team Leader Contributions**: Team leaders Jimson Bills, Ofertern Quinton, and Aceona each handled a substantial share of calls, ranging from 31.7% to 35.4%, highlighting their critical roles in operational success.  
- Call Handling Efficiency**: The total handled time for all calls reached 13,298,106 units, underscoring a need to evaluate and streamline processes to manage call durations effectively.
This analysis offers actionable insights to optimize call acceptance rates, enhance team efficiency, and ensure balanced workloads among team leaders.
